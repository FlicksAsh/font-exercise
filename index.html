    <h1>Testing the relationships between headings and paragraphs</h1>
    <p>For instance if I set a certain font weight or size color or style what will be the complementary effect between the headings and the paragraphs on the page as rendered in the browser </p>
    <h3>We will do something similar with a new set of fonts</h3>
    <p>With this heading and two paragraph combination we will try out a couple of different fonts from google fonts and see if we can strike a different effect on the eye in terms of complementarity </p>
    <p>After we like the look of the first two heading paragraph combinations we will experiment with the sizes and font weights colors ect for the pairings to see if we can achieve the perfect balance of a few different combinaitons</p>
    <h5>In the final heading we will go for the ultimate</h5>
    <p>A pairing that works well will draw the eye first to the heading and then from the heading into the body or the paragraph</p>
    <p>As we use different fonts for these different paragraphs we may also use different letter spacings along with the different font weights such that we discover an intuition for what combinaitons are pleasing to the eye in light of the goal of our application(s)</p>
    <p>And there you have it three headings and six paragraphs later we know from experience what it is like to work with typography thanks to the prompting of our great instructors on dev camp to go ahead and try out some of our own experiments with actual web pages and style sheets</p>
